## Status: developing

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). The idea of this repository is to have some necessary tools configured for a nextJS project.

## Current Tools

- Next Auth
- Prisma IO
- Tailwind CSS
- ESLint
- React Hook Form
- Zod
- Shadcn/UI

## Installation

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest --example https://github.com/lucasnp-dev/chess chess
```
